# Food journal app
## Introduction
This is a food journal app which is a sugested solution to the codemaster's <a href="https://www.codementor.io/projects/mobile/food-journal-mobile-app-atx32fsra1"> "Food journal mobile app"</a>.
The user can take a photo of the food he is currently eating and add a description to it. The photo has to be taken using the inbuild camera but easily can this be extended for the photo library as well - so the user can use a photo he was taken before.
All of the entries are displayed in a list on the app's main screen. Each entry consist of the photo, some nonoptional description and the date when it was saved. 
Tapping an food entry in the main view displays a full screen view with detail - those can be tags or location information that can be added to the Core Data model.

## Technologies
The app was written in Swift with no storyboard files which means that the whole user interface was implemented programmatically.
The entries are stored localy on the users device using a Core Data model.
In a future release i want to meet all the requirements given by the codemaster's project which means using the Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview"> Places API </a> to get the location.
